# PIG GAME

A brief description of the game is as follows:

Players take turns with a die.

On a player’s turn he/she can roll a die as many times as they like.

If a roll is a 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, the player adds that many points to their score for the turn.

A player may choose to end their turn at any time and “bank” their points.

If a player rolls a 1, they lose all their unbanked points and their turn is over.

The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
